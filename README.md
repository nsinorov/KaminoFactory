## KaminoFactory

The clone factory in Kamino got another order to clone troops. But this time you are tasked to find **the best DNA** sequence to use in the production. 

You will receive the **DNA length** and until you receive the command **"Clone them!"**, you will be receiving a **DNA sequence of ones and zeroes, split by '!' (one or several).**

You should select the sequence with the **longest subsequence of ones.** If there are several sequences with the **same length of the subsequence of ones**, print the one with the **leftmost starting index**, if there are several sequences with the same **length and starting index**, select the sequence with the **greater sum** of its elements.
